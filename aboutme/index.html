        <p>I am from ferndale Washington. I like to go for hikes and do pretty much anything outdoors. </p><p>
            I have the most fun when I am around friends and recently I have developed a love for geocaching. </p> <p>
            I study software engineering I currently work at Fedex down close to rigby. (you are welcom for your packeges.) </p><p>
            I love that the school starts everything with a prayer. I hope to learn about the different programing aspects of creating a website 
            and I would like to know if i would prefer front end development or backend development. </p><p> my favorit quote from 
            the Prophets and Apostles is from Elder Bednar. be an agent not an object to be acted upon.
